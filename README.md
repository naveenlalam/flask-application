Start Event: In Camunda, you can define a Start Event within your process model, which represents the point at which the workflow is triggered. Start Events can be configured to activate based on different triggers, such as message events, timer events, signal events, or conditional events.
Message Start Event: This type of Start Event allows a workflow to be triggered by sending a specific message to Camunda. When the message is received, the associated process instance is created and the workflow begins execution.
Timer Start Event: With a Timer Start Event, you can define a specific time or duration for the workflow to start. It allows you to schedule a process instance to begin at a predetermined time or after a certain duration has elapsed.
Signal Start Event: Signal Start Events enable workflows to be triggered by sending a signal to Camunda. Multiple process instances can be started simultaneously by signaling the same event.
Conditional Start Event: A Conditional Start Event enables you to start a workflow based on a specific condition being met. You can define conditions using business rules or expressions, and when the condition evaluates to true, the workflow is triggered.
External Service: Workflows in Camunda can be triggered by external services through the use of service tasks. These tasks represent interactions with external systems or APIs. When an external service task is invoked, it can start or continue a workflow process.
REST API: Camunda provides a REST API that allows external systems or applications to trigger workflows by making HTTP requests to the Camunda engine. You can use the API to start new process instances or signal existing ones.
Java Integration: Camunda is built on top of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), so you can integrate it with your Java applications. By using the Camunda Java API, you can programmatically start workflows by invoking the appropriate methods.
User Task Assignment: Workflows can also be triggered by assigning a user task to a specific user or group. When a user is assigned a task, they can start working on it, and the associated workflow process begins.



Capabilities

Process Modeling: Camunda provides a graphical modeling tool called Camunda Modeler that allows users to create BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagrams to represent business processes visually.
Process Execution: Camunda's core capability is executing BPMN workflows. It enables the execution of long-running, human-centric, and automated processes, allowing businesses to model and automate their end-to-end processes.
Task Management: Camunda supports task management, allowing users to define and assign tasks to participants within a process. It provides features like task lists, task assignment, task delegation, and task prioritization.
Process Monitoring and Analytics: Camunda offers monitoring and analytics capabilities to track the progress and performance of running processes. It provides real-time dashboards, historical data analysis, and reporting functionalities.
Decision Management: Camunda allows the integration of decision management capabilities using the Decision Model and Notation (DMN). It enables businesses to model and execute complex decision-making processes as part of their overall workflows.
Integration and Connectivity: Camunda supports integration with various systems and technologies through its extensive set of connectors, APIs, and messaging capabilities. It can connect to databases, message queues, REST services, and other enterprise systems.
Workflow Orchestration: Camunda enables the coordination and orchestration of multiple services and systems within a workflow. It provides features like service tasks, message events, and error handling to manage the flow and interactions between different components.
External Task Management: Camunda allows the handling of long-running external tasks asynchronously. It provides an external task client that can be used to implement workers that perform the work associated with these tasks.
User Task Forms: Camunda supports the design and rendering of user task forms, allowing users to interact with the workflow by filling out forms. It provides options for creating dynamic forms, form validation, and custom form rendering.
Security and Authorization: Camunda offers robust security features to control access to processes, tasks, and resources. It supports user authentication, authorization, and integration with external identity providers.
Deployment and Versioning: Camunda provides tools to deploy process models and manage their versions effectively. It supports version control, deployment automation, and rollbacks to ensure smooth updates and maintenance of processes.
Extensibility and Customization: Camunda is highly extensible, allowing developers to customize its behavior and integrate it into existing systems. It provides extension points, APIs, and plugin mechanisms to add custom functionalities.



Users and Tasks

User Management: Camunda allows you to define and manage individual users within the system. User management typically includes tasks such as creating new users, updating user profiles, and disabling or deleting users when necessary. Users are associated with specific roles and permissions that determine their access rights within the system.
Group Management: In addition to individual users, Camunda also supports group management. Groups are collections of users that share common characteristics or belong to the same organizational unit. Group management involves creating and managing groups, assigning users to groups, and defining group-level permissions.
Authorization and Access Control: Camunda uses role-based access control (RBAC) to define and enforce access rights. Roles are associated with specific permissions, and users or groups are assigned these roles to determine their level of access to processes, tasks, and other resources. For example, you can define roles such as "process owner," "task assignee," or "administrator" and assign them to users or groups accordingly.
Task Assignment and Delegation: Users or groups can be assigned to specific tasks within a process. Camunda allows task assignment based on roles, users, or groups. Task assignment ensures that the appropriate user or group is responsible for executing a particular task. Users can also delegate tasks to others, allowing for flexible task management and workload distribution.
User Task Forms and User Task Actions: User tasks in Camunda often require user interaction through forms. User task forms define the data that needs to be collected or displayed during task execution. Camunda supports the definition and rendering of user task forms, including various form field types, validation, and customization options. User task actions enable users to perform actions on tasks, such as claiming, completing, or delegating them.
External Identity Providers: Camunda can integrate with external identity providers, such as LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) or SSO (Single Sign-On) systems. This integration allows for centralized user management, authentication, and authorization, leveraging existing user directories and access control mechanisms.
API and Integration Support: Camunda provides APIs and integration points that enable programmatic access to user and group management functionalities. This allows you to integrate user and group management with external systems, automate user provisioning, and synchronize user data between different systems.
